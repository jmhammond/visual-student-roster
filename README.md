# What? 
Get a visual roster of the Shockers in your class in a printable form.

# Why? 
WSU used to provide visual roster. It was a security nightmare, but it was convenient.

# How? 
Using the WebExtensions API, we inject some code to parse the Banner 9 class list.  This only works while the user is authenticated into CAS. Nothing is transmitted anywhere. We just rearrange the elements that are already displayed on the page... but bigger, and more useful!

# Who? 

John Hammond, the nerdy guy over in Math.
